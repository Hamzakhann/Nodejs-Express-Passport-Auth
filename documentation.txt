first we install some packages for the app that are listed below

Express : for the server side coding
Mongoose : for the database and Schema design 
Passport :  for the authentication
passport-jwt : this is because we use JSON WEB TOKEN
jsonwebtoken  : this is actually used for generating tokens
body-parser : this is to accept coming data in json form 
bcryptjs  : it is for hash the password
validator  : this is for doing some validations

npm i -D nodemon // just for the development purpose -D


"scripts": {
    "start": "node server.js",      // after updating scripts in package.json we can use npm start to run server
    "server" : "nodemon server.js"    //npm run server to start server with nodemon
  },


  SCHEMA DESIGN:
      If you want to learn more about Schema check URL below

      u can also add method to your model to learn more chack above URL

MORGAN ::: LOGGING MIDDLEWARE
npm install --saev morgan // use logger from morgan


connect-ratelimit—
Lets you throttle connections to a certain number of requests
per hour. If someone is sending numerous requests to your server, you canstart giving them errors to stop them from bringing your site down


Helmet—Helps you add HTTP headers to make your app safer against certain
kinds of attacks. We’ll explore it in later chapters. (I’m a contributor to Helmet,
so I definitely recommend it!)

cookie-parser—Parses browser cookies.
■ response-time—Sends the X-Response-Time header so you can debug the performance
of your application
